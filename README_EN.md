# pacman
*pacman* is a Java implementation of the popular Pac-Man game. 

## Description
In *pacman*, the player guides (by using the keyboard arrows) a yellow spherical creature, called Pac-Man, making it eat all the numerous dots scattered neatly inside a maze, obtaining a point for each of them. While doing so, he must avoid being caught by four ghosts, in pain of the immediate loss of one of the lives available and the decrease of 10 points. 

At the corners of the maze, there are two stars that, if eaten by Pac-Man, allow gaining 10 points for each star and reverse the situation making the ghosts vulnerable for some seconds. To gain points, it is possible at this stage to hunt for the ghosts by getting 5 points for each ghost. Once swallowed, however, the ghosts regenerate and start attacking Pac-Man again. 

After completing a maze by engulfing all the dots, a new level starts. 

The program keeps track of the ranking of the best scores. The ranking can be visualized by pressing `ESC` on the keyboard.
